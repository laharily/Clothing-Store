				Sahara Clothing Store was founded in November of 2022. It started as
				nothing more than a simple idea by simple girls Lahari and Samvi. They were
				inspired by Mr. Scott DeRuiter's incredible AP Computer Science Principles
				Class. Through his guidance and support, they were able to turn something
				small and simple into something big and magical! Currently, Sahara Clothing
				Store is one of the most fashionable, aesthetic, and cute stores made for
				everyone! Lahari and Samvi wish you the best in your shopping experience!
				Have fun!! &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;
